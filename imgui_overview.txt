After doing the glfw , work for making a simple application window appear.
The Imgui work starts within the main function.


//all of the pre-requires function calls for glfw and opengl take place within the main function

//when u create a window using the glfw functions, u can assign the dimensions of that window, within the function
GLFWwindow8 window = glfwCreateWindow(width,height,window title, nullptr/monitor, nullptr);



Each of the imgui window can be made with :

For having custom window position and size 
ImGui::SetNextWindowSize(ImVec2());
ImGui::SetNextWindowPos(ImVec2());


//for having stylised windows and componenets with border roundign frame rounding and padding
//warning this stuff goes in a main loop, beware it is for all things on screen
ImGuiStyle* style = ImGui::GetStyle();
style.WindowRounding  = 20.0f;
style.WindowPadding = ImVec2();
style.WindowTitleAlign = ImVec2(0.5f,0.5f);
style.WindowFramePadding = ImVec2();
style.ChildRounding = 20.0f;
style.FrameRounding = 20.0f;

ImGui::PushStylwColor(ImGuiCol_WindowBg, ImVec4());
ImGui::Begin("window title",nullptr,ImGuiWindowFlags_NoResize | ImGuiWindowFlags_NoCollapse| ImGuiWindowFlags_NoMenuBar | ImGuiWindowFlags_NoMove);


//anything in between will be put within this window

//for having stuff drawn on the screen we will take drawlist from imgui
//we have ImGui::GetWindowDrawList()->AddRectFilled();
//we have ImGui::GetForegroundDrawList()-AddRectFilled();
/we have ImGui::GetBackgroundDrawList()->AddRectFilled();
//we have ImDrawlist() as well;
ImDrawList* drawlist = ImGui::GetWindowDrawList(); //and then we could do
drawlist->AddRectFilledMultiColor();



//we can aslo have a tab bar, with each individual tab depicting a different section on the window

ImGui::BeginTabBar();
ImGui::BeginTabItem();


ImGui::EndTabItem();
ImGui::EndTabBar();


ImGui::End()


//we can also change the background color of the main glfw window
the function that handles that is
glClearColor(); /this functions expects 4 values
// so incase u plan on making an ImVec4 something = ImVec4(); u can get its value like
//something.w,something.x,something.y,something.z


//for dealing with colors

{

ImU32 color_a = ImGui::GetColorU32(IM_COL32(144,24,24,255)); //rgba values
ImVec2 position = ImGui::GetCursorScreenPos();
ImVECT position_two = ImVec2(position.x , position.y);
ImGui:GetWindowDrawList()->AddRectFilledMultiColor(position,position_two, color,color,color,color);




}



//proceed with caution , following things are not to be ignored while working with imgui code
always include the begin and end functions for imgui, dont forget to end.
never leave a string empty within an imgui component function, like Begin.
always pop your style colors accordingly while working with styles. // this is the one that causes the bugs the most .
